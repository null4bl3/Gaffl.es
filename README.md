Gaffl.es is a play on words from the Danish word for "fork", this project resulted in a A+ on my final exam in Computer Science.The project is a portal offering users a platform for planning their weekly meals for dinner resulting in fewer trips to the store in the attempt to lower needless spending and consumption.
